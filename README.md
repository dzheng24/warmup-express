# warmup-express

- Express is a fast, unopinionated(means it's not a high-level framework, very basic) and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- Express is a "server-side" or "back-end" framework.

## Why use it?
  - Makes building web applications with Node easier
  - Used for both server rendere apps as well as API/Microservices
  - Light, fast, and free
  - Full control of request and response
  - By far the most popular Node framework
  - Great to use with client side frameworks (all Javascript)

## Middleware
  - Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response object.
